## 🧭 What Is StackOverflow Sage?

StackOverflow Sage is a full-stack web application designed to tackle a common pain point in the developer ecosystem: **unanswered and unclear technical questions**. By merging machine learning classification with a well-structured user interface, the application makes questions easier to understand, improve, and track.

Whether it’s on StackOverflow or within technical teams, developers often struggle to express doubts with enough precision. This app:
- Helps **formulate better questions**
- Uses ML to **analyze quality**
- Offers **visual feedback and history tracking**

##  Key Features

|  Module                   | 🛠 Description |
|----------------------------|----------------|
| ** ML Classification**   | Uses a trained **Multinomial Naive Bayes** model on actual StackOverflow data to classify questions into: `High Quality`, `Needs Edit`, or `Must Be Closed`. |
| ** MongoDB Backend**      | Connected via Mongoose; stores user data, login/signup credentials, and question history reliably. |
| ** Question Dashboard**   | A sleek dashboard displays historical queries along with their ML-determined status. Great for review and improvement. |
| ** Typed Frontend**       | Built with **React + TypeScript** to ensure type safety and scalable development. |
| ** Immersive Galaxy Theme** | A cosmic particles background enhances every page—modern, elegant, and developer-centric. |
| ** About Us + 🏠 Home Pages** | Custom-designed with thoughtful UX, clearly outlining the app’s mission and usage. |
